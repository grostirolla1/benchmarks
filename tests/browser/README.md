## Browser Benchmarks

This is a single page app that containes benchamrks for running IPFS in the browser.
The idea is that each test will have a button to active the test and give feedback on the time it takes.

This app is integrated with the benchmark running where the results are feed to the IPFS dashbaord.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

The build/index.html is avaiable via web browser and does not need a web server to view the test table.
